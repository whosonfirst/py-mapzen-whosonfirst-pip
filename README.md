# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-pip

Simple Python wrapper for talking to the go-whosonfirst-pip server

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.
